This code is used to get data from instagram for a particular location given the coordinates and a radius for any given timeframe and do k means clustering on the data. Once the users are known it gets their entire timeline and compiles all the data in a TSV file.
It was used in particular to get data for museums of NYC(like MoMa, Metropolitan museum and Museum of American history) and places like macy's and union square park. 


hist_geo.py -> Collects the user id's and posts for the given geo location, radius and timeframe

track_user.py -> Tracks the entire timeline of the users found using hist_geo.py

data_compile.py -> Filter the users who are from NYC(heuristic based approach) and compile it into a data file.

cluster_users.py -> Cluster users based on the percentage of their filter usage.

The code will need a config file which has not been uploaded because it contains sensitive keys.
